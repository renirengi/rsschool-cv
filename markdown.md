I took interest in programming about a year ago. I started my path with trying to learn C#, but soon switched to a more popular programming language - JavaScript. I used every source of information to gather knowledge: books, courses, documentation, articles, videos, etc. To be able to understand more I started taking english classes, and gradually with more and more practice, I realized that I want to be involved in this professional sphere. I have a liberal arts education, but a set of my qualities could really be useful:

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

```javascript  
   function descendingOrder(n){
      let myString=n.toString();
      let myArray=[];
      myArray = myString.split('');
      myArray.sort();
      myArray.reverse();
      myString=myArray.join('')
      return parseInt(myString);
    }
